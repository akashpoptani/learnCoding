# My Coding Learning Journey

Welcome! This repository is where I will be documenting my journey of learning coding for the next 30 days. 

I want to consistently update this space with my daily progress, new concepts, experiments, and reflections. 

This will hopefully be my living log to track growth, challenges, and achievements as I deepen my coding skills. 

Feel free to follow along or reach out if you want to collaborate or share tips!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
